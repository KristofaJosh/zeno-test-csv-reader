We have supplied you with a file named 'task_data.csv'. The programming task
that we are asking you to perform is purposely open-ended. For a Python
developer with the type of experience we are looking for, the task should not
take a significant amount of time. We have tried to design it such that it
should not take more than one hour. We do expect that you will have to refer to
some documentation, but we do not intend to have you learn a significant amount
of new Python or general development libraries, tools, or concepts.

It is the goal of the task to allow candidates to highlight decision making and
development choices in the context in which we as a team frequently work.

We expect you to use your knowledge in Docker,
We recommend the following steps in order to produce the required deliverable:

1. Create an application that transfers `task_data.csv` to a database
2. Create a _separate_ web application that is able to connect to this database
3. Serve the database data (from `task_data.csv`) in a _simple_ html format
4. On each GET request, log that the data was requested (in the same database)
5a. Package the applications into a _bare_ Git repository (send to us)
5b. Package the application into a Docker Image accessible via docker hub--provide the link
6. Prepare instructions for setting up and running the applications
7. Prepare justification for your development decisions as you see necessary

Therefore, the required deliverable is the following:

1. A _bare_ Git repository
2. Instructions for setting up and running the applications
3. Justification for your development decisions as you see necessary
4. Docker image of the solution at docker-hub

Please take care to note the _emphasized_ points.

Generally, the criteria that is worth focusing on is the following:

* Simple, clear, and fully-functional set-up instructions
* Simple, sufficient code (e.g. premature generalization is unnecessary)
* Appropriate choices of tooling and libraries given the scope of the task
* Test Driven development
* Automation
* Application Programming Interface-API
